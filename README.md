# Expenses_App_flutter
Expenses app is used to monitor out daily expenses and other transactions that we add to the stack. We can able to add, delete and monitor the past 7 days transactions with a clean looking bar chart. The bar chart works on a simple algorithm in backend where the average of transaction in a scale of 0-1 is calculated based on the past transactions.
